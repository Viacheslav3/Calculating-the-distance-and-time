# Calculating-the-distance-and-time
My main project, which I worked on, many of the files were removed because they are developments and property of the firm.
The essence of the project is to specify the zip-code and the country with which to send and zip-code and the country in which to go, 
then the calculation of time how much will be spent on this road and the distance between 2 points.
The development involved Nominatim to obtain data and GraphHopper to route between 2 points.
